        <p>Hey Kulthum‚ù§, Allen here. Sorry for taking too long to make a different move rather than asking you out. I'll still make up for it. But i hope you accept this tho. well you actually can't reject thisüòÇ. You can try but it just wouldn't worküòÇüòÇüòÇ.</p>
        <p>I love you so much and I really hope we end up together cos I don't want anyone but you, and i want to grow old with you. 
          Going to bed with you by my side every night (Well unless work separates us for a while). 
          Growing a family together and passing our features to our kids. You're so beautiful and I would love our girls, or boys to have your looks. I keep imagining a daughter looking like you whenever I think of our kids. And us sharing our cuddles with 'it' and showing it so much love. Love like we were never given. And them maybe having some more later. I pray we do end up together fr. </p>
        <p>You're the best thing to have ever happened to me in a very long time in my life. Yes we do have some bad times but we will get through those and we seem to actually actually fall in love stronger every time we are over it. I know i might make it seem as if I would never get us there cos of my inability to get over stuff or misunderstand you sometimes. But I promise you that I'll get better.</p>
        <p>This is the 'something' I'm doing and that's why I didn't tell you about my day.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry for the decline in my energy. I'll work on myself and go back being me again. I'm so sorry for that.</p>
        <p>I love you so much and I want you to know that I've made it a choice to stay and work through this little something we have here. I know sometimes I make you reconsider but please pick me also and let's face this world together. <em>"Me and you against the world".</em></p>
        <p>I love you so much baby‚ù§‚ù§</p>
        <p>I won't know your answer unfortunately but please send me your feedback privately.</p>
        <p>Love, your pookie, Allen‚ù§</p>
